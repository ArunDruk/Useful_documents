what do you mean by hooks in Cypress ?
Cypress hooks are generally used to set or define preconditions that we wish to execute either
before/after every test or before/after a set of tests.
some of the available hooks are afterEach(), after(), beforeEach() and before()

In Pytest this is achieved using Fixtures for Setup and Teardown methods

Define the components of Cypress ?
1. Test Runner - UI interactive way to run tests
2. App preview
3. Test status
4. Command Log
5. URL preview
6. Viewport sizing - Settings for adjusting view port

.\node_module\.bin\cypress run --spec D:\Automation_repo\latest_cypress\testfile.cy.js

Define Cypress run?
Cypress run assists in executing the cypress tests in Headless browsers.
It also assists in opening a New browser tab, along with that

X-Path in Cypress ?
Cypress doesn't support XPath. But, with the help of Cypress-Xpath plugin, we can use
Xpath to interact with all the DOM elements
npm install cypress-xpath

verify the title of the page?
cy.title().should('eq','OrangeHRM')

How can you read values from the configuration file ?
read the values of cypress.config file through Cypress.config()
Ex: if we have managed to define the env in the config.json (cypress.config.js) file,
such as:{"env":stage}, the same can be accessed in the script, such as:
let timeout= Cypress.config('env')

How do you maintain the test data in Cypress ?
Generally, the fixture folder has the important data in the cypress project.
It helps in getting the data input from all the external files
cy.fixture(path of test data)
